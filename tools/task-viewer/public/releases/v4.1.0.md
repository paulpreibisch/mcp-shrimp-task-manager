## üîß Usage Guide

### For New Tasks

The system is designed to work seamlessly with your existing workflow:

1. **Complete tasks as normal** - continue using your standard completion process
2. **Structured summaries** - optionally format completion summaries with Markdown headers:
   - `## Key Accomplishments`
   - `## Implementation Details` 
   - `## Technical Challenges`
3. **Automatic parsing** - the system will automatically extract structured data when available
4. **Backward compatibility** - plain text summaries continue to work perfectly

### Enhanced Task Details

When viewing completed tasks, you'll see enhanced presentation of completion information with organized sections and better visual formatting.

## üìä Example Data Structure

### Plain Text Summary (continues to work)
```json
{
  "id": "task-001",
  "name": "Implement authentication",
  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Successfully implemented JWT authentication with OAuth2 integration."
}
```

### Structured Summary (automatically parsed)
```json
{
  "id": "task-002",
  "name": "Database optimization",
  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "## Key Accomplishments\n- Optimized queries\n- Added indexing\n\n## Technical Challenges\n- Memory constraints\n\nVerification Score: 92",
  "completionDetails": {
    "keyAccomplishments": ["Optimized queries", "Added indexing"],
    "implementationDetails": [],
    "technicalChallenges": ["Memory constraints"],
    "completedAt": "2025-09-06T10:30:00.000Z",
    "verificationScore": 92
  }
}
```
