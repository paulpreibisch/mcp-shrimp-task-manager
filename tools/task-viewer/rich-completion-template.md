## 📋 Accomplishments
• Successfully reformatted HistoryView to match ArchiveView's exact table structure
• Added ID column with 8-character truncation matching archive format  
• Converted from CSS classes to inline styles for consistency
• Added Delete and Import buttons with proper hover effects
• Maintained purple gradient background and color scheme

## 🔧 Solution Features
• **Visual Consistency**: History and Archive tabs now have identical table layouts
• **Enhanced Functionality**: Users can delete and import from history like archives
• **Responsive Design**: Maintained mobile-friendly table layout
• **Theme Preservation**: Kept distinct purple branding while matching structure

## 🛠️ Technical Approach
Used test-driven development approach with comprehensive test coverage before implementation. Applied ArchiveView's proven table structure while preserving HistoryView's unique purple branding.

## 🧠 Key Decisions
Converted component from CSS-class-based styling to inline styles for consistency with ArchiveView. This ensures both components render identically across different environments while maintaining their distinct color schemes.

## Next Steps

1. **Modify verify_task process** to accept rich completion data
2. **Create verification templates** for different types of tasks  
3. **Update agent workflows** to capture and structure this information
4. **Test with real tasks** to refine the approach
