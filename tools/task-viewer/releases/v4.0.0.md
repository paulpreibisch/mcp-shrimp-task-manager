# 🦐 Shrimp Task Manager v4.0.0 Release Notes

*Released: 2025-01-02*

## 🎉 Major New Features

### 📚 Complete Archive Management System

The Archive feature revolutionizes how you manage your task lists. Have you ever created a complex set of tasks from a detailed initial request, only to realize you need to work on something else first? The Archive system solves this problem perfectly.

When you archive a task list, the entire collection of tasks - including the initial request that spawned them - is safely stored for later use. This allows you to start fresh with a new task list without losing any of your previous planning work. When you're ready to return to those archived tasks, simply import them back into your current workflow. This is particularly useful for developers who work on multiple features simultaneously or need to switch contexts frequently.

The Archive interface shares the same polished design as the History page, providing a consistent and intuitive user experience across the application. You can view all your archived task lists, see when they were created, and quickly restore any archive when needed.

### 💡 Initial Request Display & Summary Generation

One of the most requested features is now here - the ability to see and understand the context behind your task lists. The Initial Request Display captures and permanently stores the original user request that initiated task planning. This means weeks or months later, you can instantly refresh your memory about why these tasks exist and what problem they were meant to solve.

But we didn't stop there. We've also added an intelligent Summary feature that leverages OpenAI to generate concise overviews of what has been accomplished. Simply click the Summary button, and using your OpenAI API key, the system will analyze all completed tasks and provide you with a clear synopsis of your progress. This is invaluable for project status updates, team communications, or simply understanding where you stand with complex implementations.

### 🤖 Enhanced Agent Management

We've significantly expanded the agent capabilities in this release. The new bulk agent assignment feature allows you to assign multiple tasks to AI agents simultaneously through an intuitive dropdown interface. Individual task assignments now happen without page refreshes, making the workflow smoother and more efficient.

The agent information modal has been completely overhauled to provide clearer descriptions and better visibility into agent capabilities. We've also fixed critical issues where agent descriptions would appear blank and resolved the 500 errors that occurred when working with production task lists.

### 📖 Revolutionary Release Notes Experience

The Release Notes system has been completely reimagined from the ground up. Instead of static text, you now have an interactive, navigable experience with a collapsible Table of Contents in the sidebar. Each version can be expanded to show its section outline, allowing you to quickly jump to the information you need.

We've implemented sophisticated styling with color-coded headings - pink for main sections, white for "New Features", orange for "Bug Fixes", and light blue for overview sections. The text is 25% larger for better readability, and all markdown elements from h2 to h5 are properly rendered.

The sidebar and content areas scroll independently, ensuring you never lose your place while navigating through extensive documentation. Custom teal-themed scrollbars provide visual consistency with the application's design language.

### 📊 Redesigned History View

The History View has been transformed to match the polished interface of the Archive system. Most importantly, it now displays the Initial Request instead of notes in the main view, giving you immediate context about each historical task list. The layout has been optimized with better column spacing and more efficient filtering capabilities.

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Performance & Infrastructure

We've made significant improvements to the application's performance and development experience. The new build system includes a simplified `npm run build` command that automatically builds and starts the server. Playwright has been integrated for end-to-end testing, ensuring UI reliability across updates.

The server has been enhanced with new archive endpoints featuring improved error handling and validation. Response times have been optimized through better data fetching strategies.

This release includes comprehensive test coverage for all new features:
- Archive functionality tests
- Release Notes scrolling tests

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### Scrolling Issues Resolved

We've fixed the critical scrollbar visibility issues that affected the Release Notes and other tabs. The application now properly displays scrollbars with custom styling, ensuring content is always accessible. Independent scrolling between sidebar and content areas works flawlessly.

- Color contrast has been improved throughout the interface
- Loading states are now more informative
- Error messages provide clearer guidance
