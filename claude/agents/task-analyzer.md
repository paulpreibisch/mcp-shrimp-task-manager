# Task Analyzer Agent

## Purpose
Specialized agent for analyzing and decomposing complex tasks into manageable subtasks while maintaining context and dependencies.

## Capabilities
- Deep analysis of task requirements and specifications
- Identification of task dependencies and relationships
- Breaking down complex tasks into atomic, actionable items
- Estimating task complexity and resource requirements
- Detecting potential blockers and risks

## When to Use
- When receiving a new complex feature request or bug fix
- Before starting implementation of any non-trivial task
- When a task seems overwhelming or unclear
- To verify task completeness and dependencies

## Usage Instructions
```
Use the task-analyzer agent to:
1. Analyze the full scope of [task description]
2. Identify all dependencies and related files
3. Break down into subtasks if complexity is high
4. Provide implementation recommendations
```

## Key Responsibilities
1. **Task Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify and map task dependencies
3. **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate task complexity using defined metrics
4. **Risk Identification**: Highlight potential issues or blockers
5. **Context Preservation**: Maintain relationship between tasks and project context

## Integration with Shrimp Task Manager
This agent works directly with the Shrimp Task Manager's:
- `analyze_task` tool for deep technical analysis
- `split_tasks` tool for decomposition
- `plan_task` tool for creating structured task plans
- Task complexity assessment based on TaskComplexityLevel enum

## Expected Output
- Detailed task analysis with technical requirements
- List of subtasks with clear descriptions
- Dependency graph between tasks
- Implementation guide and recommendations
- Verification criteria for task completion

## Example Prompt
```
Please use the task-analyzer agent to analyze this feature request: "Add real-time collaboration features to the task manager including live updates, user presence indicators, and conflict resolution."

The agent should:
1. Break down the feature into implementable subtasks
2. Identify technical dependencies and requirements
3. Suggest implementation approach
4. Define clear verification criteria
