# Story 1.1: Create MadShrimp Conversational Agent

## Status: Done

## Story
As a developer,
I want to use `/madshrimp` command to access all BMAD PM capabilities,
so that I can continue natural conversational workflow with enhanced verification capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `/madshrimp` command activates agent with full BMAD PM persona and commands
2. Agent provides all existing PM capabilities (*create-prd, *create-epic, *create-story, *shard-prd)
3. Agent responds conversationally without requiring subcommand syntax
4. Agent maintains John PM identity and investigative, data-driven approach

## Dev Notes
**Parallel Work:** Multi-Dev OK
**Reason:** Creates new independent agent file with no shared dependencies

**Technical Context from Architecture:**
- Create new agent file at `/agents/madshrimp.md` following BMAD agent structure
- Agent must inherit all PM capabilities from `bmad-core/agents/pm.md`
- Add MadShrimp-specific commands for verification queries and status checks
- Use YAML configuration block format with activation-instructions
- Maintain dependencies on existing PM tasks and templates

**Integration Points:**
- Must be compatible with existing BMAD agent activation system
- Should trigger MCP tools for verification when stories complete
- Needs to handle both standard BMAD workflows and MadShrimp enhancements

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create `/agents/madshrimp.md` file with YAML configuration block (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Copy base structure from PM agent
  - [ ] Add MadShrimp-specific persona definition
  - [ ] Include all PM dependencies (tasks, templates, checklists)
- [ ] Task 2: Add MadShrimp-specific commands (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Include all standard PM commands (*create-prd, *create-epic, etc.)
  - [ ] Add verification query commands (*show-verification, *story-status)
  - [ ] Add auto-verification trigger commands
- [ ] Task 3: Configure agent activation and conversational flow (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Set up natural language command processing
  - [ ] Maintain John persona characteristics
  - [ ] Add help text for new MadShrimp capabilities
- [ ] Task 4: Test agent activation and command execution (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Verify `/madshrimp` command activates properly
  - [ ] Test all PM commands work as expected
  - [ ] Confirm conversational responses match PM style

## Integration Verification
- [ ] IV1: All standard BMAD PM workflows function identically through MadShrimp agent
- [ ] IV2: Agent activation and command processing maintains existing response times
- [ ] IV3: BMAD story files created through MadShrimp match standard BMAD format exactly

## Testing
- Test activation with `/madshrimp` command
- Verify all PM commands (*create-prd, *create-epic, *create-story, *shard-prd) work
- Test conversational responses without subcommand syntax
- Verify John PM persona is maintained

## File List
- `/agents/madshrimp.md` - NEW
