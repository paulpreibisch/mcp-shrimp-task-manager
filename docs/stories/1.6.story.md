# Story 1.6: Enable PRD Editing Through Visual Interface

## Status: Done

## Story
As a product manager,
I want to edit PRD content through the Shrimp visual dashboard,
so that I can update requirements and epic details using a rich text interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PRD sections display with inline editing capabilities for requirements and epic descriptions
2. Rich text editor supports markdown formatting and maintains PRD structure
3. Changes automatically save to `docs/prd.md` in BMAD-compatible format
4. Edit history and version tracking for PRD changes

## Dev Notes
**Parallel Work:** Multi-Dev OK
**Reason:** Creates new independent PRD editor components with separate API endpoints

**Technical Context from Architecture:**
- Create PRD editor component in `/tools/task-viewer/src/components/`
- Implement PRD file writer API preserving BMAD format
- Use Monaco Editor or similar for rich markdown editing
- Maintain exact PRD structure including all sections
- Add version control with diff viewing

**PRD Structure to Preserve:**
```markdown
# [Project Title]

## Executive Summary
[Content - editable]

## Goals & Objectives
[Content - editable]

## User Stories
[Epic sections - editable with structure preservation]

## Success Criteria
[Content - editable]

## Technical Considerations
[Content - editable]

## Implementation Phases
[Content - preserve structure]

## Risks & Mitigations
[Table format - preserve structure]
```

**Editor Requirements:**
- Section-based editing (not full document at once)
- Markdown syntax highlighting
- Live preview panel
- Undo/redo support
- Auto-save with debouncing
- Version history sidebar

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create PRD editor component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Implement `/tools/task-viewer/src/components/PRDEditor.jsx`
  - [ ] Add section-based editing controls
  - [ ] Integrate Monaco Editor for markdown
  - [ ] Test ID: `data-testid="prd-section-{name}-editor"`
- [ ] Task 2: Implement PRD parser and formatter (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create `/tools/task-viewer/src/utils/prd-parser.js`
  - [ ] Parse PRD into editable sections
  - [ ] Maintain section order and structure
  - [ ] Format back to BMAD-compatible markdown
- [ ] Task 3: Create PRD writer API (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add PUT /api/bmad/prd endpoint
  - [ ] Validate PRD structure before saving
  - [ ] Write to `docs/prd.md` atomically
  - [ ] Implement backup before overwrite
- [ ] Task 4: Add version tracking (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create `/tools/task-viewer/src/components/PRDHistory.jsx`
  - [ ] Store versions in `.ai/prd-history/`
  - [ ] Implement diff viewer component
  - [ ] Add restore from history capability
- [ ] Task 5: Implement auto-save and conflict handling (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add debounced auto-save (3 second delay)
  - [ ] Detect external file changes
  - [ ] Show conflict resolution dialog
  - [ ] Implement three-way merge for conflicts

## Integration Verification
- [ ] IV1: PRD edits maintain markdown structure and BMAD template compliance
- [ ] IV2: MadShrimp agent can access and reference updated PRD content immediately
- [ ] IV3: PRD editing does not conflict with BMAD shard-prd or other PRD operations

## Testing
- Test section-based editing preserves structure
- Verify markdown formatting is maintained
- Test version history and restoration
- Confirm auto-save functionality
- Test conflict detection and resolution

## File List
- `/tools/task-viewer/src/components/PRDEditor.jsx` - NEW
- `/tools/task-viewer/src/components/PRDHistory.jsx` - NEW
- `/tools/task-viewer/src/utils/prd-parser.js` - NEW
- `/tools/task-viewer/src/utils/prd-differ.js` - NEW
