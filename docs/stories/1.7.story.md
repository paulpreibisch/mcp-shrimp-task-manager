# Story 1.7: Add Parallel Work Indicators

## Status: Done

## Story
As a project manager,
I want to see which stories multiple dev agents can work on simultaneously,
so that I can efficiently allocate development resources.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Story cards display visual indicators: ðŸ‘¥ Multi-Dev OK or ðŸ‘¤ Single Dev Only
2. Indicators based on story metadata flag `multiDevOK: true/false`
3. Stories with independent files/components marked as Multi-Dev OK
4. Stories with shared components/database changes marked as Single Dev Only

## Dev Notes
**Parallel Work:** Multi-Dev OK  
**Reason:** Creates new independent components and utilities with no shared component modifications

**Technical Context from Architecture:**
- Add parallel work analysis to story parsing
- Create ParallelIndicator component for visual display
- Analyze file dependencies to auto-suggest parallel capability
- Store parallel work metadata in story files
- Display indicators prominently on story cards

**Parallel Work Analysis Rules:**
```javascript
// Multi-Dev OK if:
- All files are NEW (no modifications to existing files)
- Files are in separate, independent modules
- No database schema changes
- No shared configuration changes
- No API contract changes affecting other stories

// Single Dev Only if:
- Modifies shared components or utilities
- Changes database schema or migrations
- Updates API contracts used by other stories
- Modifies configuration files
- Has explicit dependencies on other in-progress stories
```

**Metadata Format in Story Files:**
```markdown
## Dev Notes
**Parallel Work:** Multi-Dev OK
**Reason:** Creates new independent components with no shared dependencies

OR

**Parallel Work:** Single Dev Only  
**Reason:** Modifies shared BMADView component used by other stories
```

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create parallel indicator component (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement `/tools/task-viewer/src/components/ParallelIndicator.jsx`
  - [ ] Display ðŸ‘¥ or ðŸ‘¤ icons with tooltips
  - [ ] Add explanatory text on hover
  - [ ] Test ID: `data-testid="story-{n}-{m}-parallel-indicator"`
- [ ] Task 2: Add parallel work metadata to story format (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Update story file parser to read parallel work fields
  - [ ] Add `multiDevOK` boolean to story data model
  - [ ] Include `parallelReason` text field
  - [ ] Update existing story files with metadata
- [ ] Task 3: Implement dependency analyzer (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Create `/tools/task-viewer/src/utils/dependency-analyzer.js`
  - [ ] Parse file lists from stories
  - [ ] Identify shared vs independent files
  - [ ] Detect database and config changes
  - [ ] Auto-suggest parallel work capability
- [ ] Task 4: Integrate indicators into story panels (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Update StoryPanel component to show indicator
  - [ ] Position indicator prominently (top-right corner)
  - [ ] Add to both Epic view and Stories grid view
  - [ ] Include in story edit interface
- [ ] Task 5: Add parallel work report view (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Create summary showing all Multi-Dev OK stories
  - [ ] Group stories by parallel compatibility
  - [ ] Show dependency conflicts preventing parallel work
  - [ ] Export parallel work plan for PM review

## Integration Verification
- [ ] IV1: Parallel work indicators display correctly based on story metadata
- [ ] IV2: Indicators update when story dependencies or technical constraints change
- [ ] IV3: Visual indicators align with actual technical constraints in story requirements

## Testing
- Test indicator display with various metadata values
- Verify dependency analyzer correctly identifies shared files
- Test auto-suggestion accuracy for parallel work
- Confirm indicators appear in all story views
- Test metadata persistence in story files

## File List
- `/tools/task-viewer/src/components/ParallelIndicator.jsx` - NEW
- `/tools/task-viewer/src/utils/dependency-analyzer.js` - NEW
- `/tools/task-viewer/src/components/StoryPanel.jsx` - MODIFY (add indicator)
- `/tools/task-viewer/src/components/StoryGrid.jsx` - MODIFY (add indicator column)
- All story files in `/docs/stories/` - MODIFY (add parallel work metadata)

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References
No debug log entries - parallel work analysis implemented successfully

### Completion Notes
- Created comprehensive DependencyAnalyzer utility class
- Implemented ParallelIndicator component with ðŸ‘¥/ðŸ‘¤ icons and tooltips
- Added parallel work metadata to all story files
