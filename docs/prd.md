# MadShrimp Integration Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis of existing MCP Shrimp Task Manager and BMAD-METHOD integration

**Current Project State**: We have two separate but powerful systems:
- **MCP Shrimp Task Manager**: Advanced task management with plan‚Üíanalyze‚Üísplit‚Üíexecute‚Üíverify workflow, visual task viewer with React components, comprehensive task tracking with metadata support
- **BMAD-METHOD**: Agent-based development framework with conversational CLI agents (PM, Dev, SM, QA), story-centric planning approach, expansion pack architecture for domain extensions

### Available Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation**:
‚úÖ Tech Stack Documentation (Both systems well-documented)
‚úÖ Source Tree/Architecture (Clear component structure in both)
‚úÖ API Documentation (MCP tools and BMAD agent dependencies)
‚úÖ External API Documentation (MCP integration patterns)
‚ö†Ô∏è UX/UI Guidelines (Partial - Shrimp has React components, BMAD has CLI patterns)
‚úÖ Technical Debt Documentation (Both systems identify integration points)

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ‚úÖ Integration with New Systems (Verification & Tracking Integration)

**Enhancement Description**: Create hybrid MadShrimp system that preserves BMAD's full execution workflow (planning, story creation, SM‚ÜíDev implementation) while adding Shrimp's verification capabilities and visual project tracking through a single `/madshrimp` command interface.

**Impact Assessment**: ‚úÖ Minimal Impact (isolated additions) - Pure extension approach with no changes to existing execution workflows

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Preserve complete BMAD execution workflow (PM, SM, Dev agent conversations)
- Add automatic verification capture when BMAD stories are marked complete
- Provide visual project dashboard showing story progress and verification details
- Enable Epic.Story visual organization without changing BMAD's story-centric execution
- Maintain single `/madshrimp` conversational interface
- Enable story and PRD editing through visual interface
- Display parallel work indicators for multi-dev agent planning

**Background Context**: Developers love BMAD's conversational workflow and execution model but want the rich verification details and visual project tracking that Shrimp provides. The integration should feel like an enhanced BMAD PM that automatically captures implementation learnings and provides visual project insights without changing how development work gets done.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The `/madshrimp` command shall provide all existing BMAD PM agent capabilities (create-prd, create-epic, create-story, shard-prd) without modification to core BMAD workflows.

**FR2**: When BMAD stories are marked as "Done" or "Ready for Review", the system shall automatically trigger Shrimp verification to capture implementation details, technical challenges, and completion quality scores.

**FR3**: The visual dashboard shall display BMAD story progress organized by Epic with completion status, verification scores, and implementation details without requiring user interaction for updates.

**FR4**: The system shall maintain Epic.Story numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3) for visual organization while preserving BMAD's native story file structure and workflows.

**FR5**: The MadShrimp agent shall provide conversational access to view verification results and project status through natural language queries (e.g., "Show me verification details for story 1.2").

**FR6**: All BMAD story creation, modification, and SM‚ÜíDev‚ÜíQA execution workflows shall remain completely unchanged from standard BMAD operation.

**FR7**: The Shrimp Task Manager visual interface shall provide editing capabilities for BMAD stories, allowing users to modify story content, acceptance criteria, and status through the web interface.

**FR8**: The Shrimp Task Manager interface shall provide PRD editing capabilities, enabling users to update product requirements, epic descriptions, and project details through the visual dashboard.

**FR9**: All edits made through the Shrimp visual interface shall automatically synchronize back to BMAD story files and PRD files, maintaining file format compatibility.

**FR10**: The system shall provide conflict resolution when simultaneous edits occur through both CLI (MadShrimp agent) and visual interface (Shrimp dashboard).

**FR11**: Story cards in the visual interface shall display indicators showing whether multiple dev agents can work on the story simultaneously without conflicts.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Auto-verification must complete within 30 seconds of story completion notification to maintain development flow.

**NFR2**: Visual dashboard must update in real-time without requiring page refresh when story statuses change.

**NFR3**: Integration must not impact BMAD agent response times or modify any existing BMAD source code files.

**NFR4**: System must handle concurrent story completions and verification requests without data loss or conflicting updates.

**NFR5**: Verification data and visual tracking must persist across system restarts and maintain historical completion records.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: All existing BMAD agent commands and workflows must function identically with or without MadShrimp integration enabled.

**CR2**: BMAD story file formats and directory structures must remain unchanged and compatible with standard BMAD tooling.

**CR3**: Visual dashboard must integrate with existing Shrimp task viewer UI components without breaking current functionality.

**CR4**: MCP tool integration must be backward compatible and not interfere with existing Shrimp task management features.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript/JavaScript (MCP Shrimp), Markdown/YAML (BMAD agents)
**Frameworks**: React (Shrimp viewer), Node.js (Shrimp server), BMAD agent framework
**Database**: File-based (BMAD stories), JSON state (Shrimp tasks)
**Infrastructure**: MCP server architecture, CLI agent system
**External Dependencies**: BMAD-METHOD core, MCP protocol, React components

### Integration Approach

**Verification Integration Strategy**: File system watching for BMAD story status changes + MCP tool calls for auto-verification trigger when stories marked complete

**API Integration Strategy**: New MCP tools (`auto_verify_bmad_story`, `update_story_dashboard`, `organize_epic_structure`) bridge BMAD story completion events to Shrimp verification workflow

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Extend existing BMADView component with Epic-based organization, verification result display, and story/PRD editing capabilities

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Verification integration testing through BMAD story completion simulation, visual dashboard update validation

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: 
- MadShrimp agent: `/home/fire/claude/mcp-shrimp-task-manager/agents/madshrimp.md`
- New MCP tools: Extend existing `src/tools/` directory structure
- UI components: Enhance existing `tools/task-viewer/src/components/BMADView.jsx`

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing patterns - `mcp__shrimp-task-manager__` prefix for new tools, camelCase for React components

**Coding Standards**: Maintain TypeScript strict mode, React functional components, BMAD YAML agent structure

**Documentation Standards**: Inline JSDoc for new functions, BMAD agent YAML documentation blocks

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Extend existing npm scripts, no additional build pipeline needed

**Deployment Strategy**: File-based deployment for MadShrimp agent, existing server restart for MCP tools

**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing console logging, add verification completion tracking

**Configuration Management**: Optional feature flags in environment variables, backward compatible defaults

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: File system watching reliability, verification timing conflicts
**Integration Risks**: BMAD story format changes, MCP protocol updates
**Deployment Risks**: Agent file conflicts, React component integration issues
**Mitigation Strategies**: Graceful fallback to manual verification, comprehensive integration testing, version compatibility checks
