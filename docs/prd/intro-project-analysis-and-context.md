# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis of existing MCP Shrimp Task Manager and BMAD-METHOD integration

**Current Project State**: We have two separate but powerful systems:
- **MCP Shrimp Task Manager**: Advanced task management with plan→analyze→split→execute→verify workflow, visual task viewer with React components, comprehensive task tracking with metadata support
- **BMAD-METHOD**: Agent-based development framework with conversational CLI agents (PM, Dev, SM, QA), story-centric planning approach, expansion pack architecture for domain extensions

## Available Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation**:
✅ Tech Stack Documentation (Both systems well-documented)
✅ Source Tree/Architecture (Clear component structure in both)
✅ API Documentation (MCP tools and BMAD agent dependencies)
✅ External API Documentation (MCP integration patterns)
⚠️ UX/UI Guidelines (Partial - Shrimp has React components, BMAD has CLI patterns)
✅ Technical Debt Documentation (Both systems identify integration points)

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ Integration with New Systems (Verification & Tracking Integration)

**Enhancement Description**: Create hybrid MadShrimp system that preserves BMAD's full execution workflow (planning, story creation, SM→Dev implementation) while adding Shrimp's verification capabilities and visual project tracking through a single `/madshrimp` command interface.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ Minimal Impact (isolated additions) - Pure extension approach with no changes to existing execution workflows

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Preserve complete BMAD execution workflow (PM, SM, Dev agent conversations)
- Add automatic verification capture when BMAD stories are marked complete
- Provide visual project dashboard showing story progress and verification details
- Enable Epic.Story visual organization without changing BMAD's story-centric execution
- Maintain single `/madshrimp` conversational interface
- Enable story and PRD editing through visual interface
- Display parallel work indicators for multi-dev agent planning

**Background Context**: Developers love BMAD's conversational workflow and execution model but want the rich verification details and visual project tracking that Shrimp provides. The integration should feel like an enhanced BMAD PM that automatically captures implementation learnings and provides visual project insights without changing how development work gets done.
