# Epic 1: MadShrimp Integration - BMAD Execution with Shrimp Verification & Visual Tracking

**Epic Goal**: Enable developers to continue using natural BMAD conversational workflows while automatically capturing rich verification details and providing visual project tracking through seamless integration.

**Integration Requirements**: Preserve all existing BMAD agent functionality, add non-intrusive verification automation, extend visual dashboard with BMAD story organization.

## Story 1.1: Create MadShrimp Conversational Agent

As a developer,
I want to use `/madshrimp` command to access all BMAD PM capabilities,
so that I can continue natural conversational workflow with enhanced verification capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. `/madshrimp` command activates agent with full BMAD PM persona and commands
2. Agent provides all existing PM capabilities (*create-prd, *create-epic, *create-story, *shard-prd)
3. Agent responds conversationally without requiring subcommand syntax
4. Agent maintains John PM identity and investigative, data-driven approach

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: All standard BMAD PM workflows function identically through MadShrimp agent
- IV2: Agent activation and command processing maintains existing response times
- IV3: BMAD story files created through MadShrimp match standard BMAD format exactly

## Story 1.2: Implement Auto-Verification MCP Tools

As a developer,
I want story completion to automatically trigger verification capture,
so that implementation details and challenges are documented without manual effort.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. New MCP tool `mcp__shrimp-task-manager__auto_verify_bmad_story` detects story completion
2. Tool captures implementation details, technical challenges, and quality scores
3. Verification completes within 30 seconds of story status change
4. Verification data persists and remains accessible through conversational queries

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: BMAD story status changes trigger verification without impacting story file integrity
- IV2: Verification process does not interfere with ongoing BMAD agent operations
- IV3: Failed verification attempts gracefully fallback without blocking story completion

## Story 1.3: Extend Visual Dashboard with Epic Organization

As a developer,
I want to see BMAD stories organized by Epic with verification details in visual dashboard,
so that I can track project progress and review implementation learnings.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. BMADView component displays stories organized by Epic (1.1, 1.2, 1.3 format)
2. Each story shows completion status, verification score, and implementation details
3. Dashboard updates automatically when story statuses change
4. Epic progress indicators show completion percentage and verification summaries

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Visual dashboard integration maintains existing Shrimp task viewer functionality
- IV2: Real-time updates function without page refresh or performance degradation
- IV3: Epic organization handles multiple concurrent story updates correctly

## Story 1.4: Enable Conversational Access to Verification Data

As a developer,
I want to query verification results through natural conversation with MadShrimp,
so that I can review implementation details without leaving the CLI interface.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. MadShrimp agent responds to queries like "Show verification details for story 1.2"
2. Agent provides verification scores, technical challenges, and implementation notes conversationally
3. Agent can summarize epic progress and highlight stories needing attention
4. Verification data access integrates seamlessly with other PM conversations

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Conversational verification access maintains agent response consistency
- IV2: Verification data queries do not conflict with standard BMAD PM operations
- IV3: Agent gracefully handles requests for non-existent or incomplete verification data

## Story 1.5: Enable Story Editing Through Visual Interface

As a developer,
I want to edit BMAD stories directly through the Shrimp visual dashboard,
so that I can update story details, acceptance criteria, and status without switching to CLI.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Story cards in visual dashboard include edit buttons for title, description, and acceptance criteria
2. Story status can be updated through dropdown or status workflow controls
3. Edits automatically save and sync back to BMAD story files in correct format
4. Real-time preview shows formatted story content before saving

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Edited story files maintain BMAD-compatible format and structure
- IV2: CLI access to edited stories shows updated content immediately
- IV3: Concurrent CLI and visual edits are handled with conflict resolution

## Story 1.6: Enable PRD Editing Through Visual Interface

As a product manager,
I want to edit PRD content through the Shrimp visual dashboard,
so that I can update requirements and epic details using a rich text interface.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. PRD sections display with inline editing capabilities for requirements and epic descriptions
2. Rich text editor supports markdown formatting and maintains PRD structure
3. Changes automatically save to `docs/prd.md` in BMAD-compatible format
4. Edit history and version tracking for PRD changes

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: PRD edits maintain markdown structure and BMAD template compliance
- IV2: MadShrimp agent can access and reference updated PRD content immediately
- IV3: PRD editing does not conflict with BMAD shard-prd or other PRD operations

## Story 1.7: Add Parallel Work Indicators

As a project manager,
I want to see which stories multiple dev agents can work on simultaneously,
so that I can efficiently allocate development resources.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Story cards display visual indicators: ðŸ‘¥ Multi-Dev OK or ðŸ‘¤ Single Dev Only
2. Indicators based on story metadata flag `multiDevOK: true/false`
3. Stories with independent files/components marked as Multi-Dev OK
4. Stories with shared components/database changes marked as Single Dev Only

**Integration Verification**:
- IV1: Parallel work indicators display correctly based on story metadata
- IV2: Indicators update when story dependencies or technical constraints change
- IV3: Visual indicators align with actual technical constraints in story requirements
