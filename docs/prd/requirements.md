# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The `/madshrimp` command shall provide all existing BMAD PM agent capabilities (create-prd, create-epic, create-story, shard-prd) without modification to core BMAD workflows.

**FR2**: When BMAD stories are marked as "Done" or "Ready for Review", the system shall automatically trigger Shrimp verification to capture implementation details, technical challenges, and completion quality scores.

**FR3**: The visual dashboard shall display BMAD story progress organized by Epic with completion status, verification scores, and implementation details without requiring user interaction for updates.

**FR4**: The system shall maintain Epic.Story numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3) for visual organization while preserving BMAD's native story file structure and workflows.

**FR5**: The MadShrimp agent shall provide conversational access to view verification results and project status through natural language queries (e.g., "Show me verification details for story 1.2").

**FR6**: All BMAD story creation, modification, and SM→Dev→QA execution workflows shall remain completely unchanged from standard BMAD operation.

**FR7**: The Shrimp Task Manager visual interface shall provide editing capabilities for BMAD stories, allowing users to modify story content, acceptance criteria, and status through the web interface.

**FR8**: The Shrimp Task Manager interface shall provide PRD editing capabilities, enabling users to update product requirements, epic descriptions, and project details through the visual dashboard.

**FR9**: All edits made through the Shrimp visual interface shall automatically synchronize back to BMAD story files and PRD files, maintaining file format compatibility.

**FR10**: The system shall provide conflict resolution when simultaneous edits occur through both CLI (MadShrimp agent) and visual interface (Shrimp dashboard).

**FR11**: Story cards in the visual interface shall display indicators showing whether multiple dev agents can work on the story simultaneously without conflicts.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Auto-verification must complete within 30 seconds of story completion notification to maintain development flow.

**NFR2**: Visual dashboard must update in real-time without requiring page refresh when story statuses change.

**NFR3**: Integration must not impact BMAD agent response times or modify any existing BMAD source code files.

**NFR4**: System must handle concurrent story completions and verification requests without data loss or conflicting updates.

**NFR5**: Verification data and visual tracking must persist across system restarts and maintain historical completion records.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: All existing BMAD agent commands and workflows must function identically with or without MadShrimp integration enabled.

**CR2**: BMAD story file formats and directory structures must remain unchanged and compatible with standard BMAD tooling.

**CR3**: Visual dashboard must integrate with existing Shrimp task viewer UI components without breaking current functionality.

**CR4**: MCP tool integration must be backward compatible and not interfere with existing Shrimp task management features.
