# Performance Considerations

## Frontend Optimization
- Virtualize long story lists (React Window)
- Lazy load verification details
- Implement progressive disclosure for nested tabs
- Cache API responses with SWR or React Query

## Backend Optimization
- Batch file system operations
- Implement connection pooling for API requests
- Use worker threads for verification processing
- Cache frequently accessed story data

## Real-time Updates
- Use Server-Sent Events for dashboard updates
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Debounce rapid status changes
- Use WebSocket for bi-directional editing
